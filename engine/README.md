# engine module

The engine module is a port of the Tractor Toolkit engine package. Most notably the [Assembly](https://github.com/tractordev/toolkit/blob/main/engine/assembly.go) type and `Run` method. This will provide a simple dependency injection system using TypeScript type data via schemas by way of the reflect module in this repo.

See `examples/engine` for what this would look like.
